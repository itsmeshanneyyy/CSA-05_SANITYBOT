Five or more out of 9 symptoms (including at least one of depressed mood and loss of interest or pleasure) in the same 2-week period, depressed mood (subjective or observed); can be irritable mood in children and adolescents, most of the day, loss of interest or pleasure, in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, change in weight or appetite (weight: 5% change over 1 month), insomnia or hypersomnia; nearly every day, psychomotor retardation or agitation (observed by others, not subjective feelings of being slowed down or restlessness), loss of energy or fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt, diminished concentration or indecisiveness;",

The EPDS is a 10-question survey that asks about feelings and experiences over the past week. If you are experiencing symptoms of postpartum depression, it is important to speak with your healthcare provider and seek support."
